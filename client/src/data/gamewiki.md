The main role isn't just to kill the **🎯 Enemies**, by controlling the **💣 Cannon** obviously ;)

*but also*

Strategically plan for the battle by choosing the right equipment & army (**💣 Cannon**, **🧱 Fence**, **🏰 Castle**, **🤺 Citizen Workers**) from the **🏪 Item Shop** and determining when to save and when to spend your **🪙 Gold**.

## 👀 Who said "boring" ?!

The game offers two modes: offline basic mode and online competitive mode.

##### In the offline mode ....
- Each time you open the game, you start exploring the game levels from 🎚️ Level 1 and on.
- If you got defeated in some level, you restart from 🎚️ Level 1 again.
- Pretty good for an offline game, right :)

##### In the online mode ....
- After signing in to your account, you progress is saved after winning each level.
- If you got defeated in some level, you'll stuck trying hard to pass it.
- ***The exciting part*** : joining the online game mode means you joined *Clash of Clans | Tower Defense Leaderboard*, competing 🏅 **globally** and 🎖️ **locally**, if you joined a clan ;) , to get your name to the top of the Leaderboard.

*Note: The Leaderboard is ranked based on* 🎚️ *Level primarily and* 🪙 *Gold secondarily.*

## 🏪 Item Shop

- By killing enemies, you start to earn 🪙 *Gold*, which you can spend (or save depending on the mighty General's strategic plan) in the Item Shop.

- The stats of the next 🎯 Enemy is always showed in the Item Shop.

**The only advice we would give is to know your enemies well 🫵**
