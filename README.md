### Patch Notes (V2.0)

**Game Launcher :**
- Removed "Settings" Button
- Added "Ranked (Online)" Button that connects the user to our Online Database (*hosted on [Render](https://render.com/)*) to join the [Leaderboard on our Website](https://mikhaelmounay.github.io/ClashofClansTowerDefenseGame/).

**Game :**
- New levels added. We know the limit is the sky when competing with friends. The game now contains endless levels so you always have the room to climb to rank 1 again.
	Technically, the game contains a fixed set of 25 levels, which can be increased in the future. The levels' graphics are repeated in a cyclic loop every 25 levels but with different stats for the enemy.
- New Item Shop added. Make sure to prepare for the battle well before locking in.
- Added health bars for the enemy, fence, and the castle.
- Added some exciting sound effects for each part of the game.

**Game Mechanics :**
- Unit movement is based on the shortest path they can find to the castle.
- Workers sprint to fix the damaged fence units in chronological order.

### Further Improvements to Work on Next Patch

*Further developments are numerous and the game is publicly [open on GitHub](https://github.com/MikhaelMounay/ClashofClansTowerDefenseGame/) for everyone who wants to contribute.*

Further developments we have in mind for now:
- Improvements in the A* Algorithm implementation, especially to deal correctly with invisible Pixmap edges.
- Change the order in which workers fix the damaged fence units to be based on the closest to the worker instead of the chronological order of being damaged.
- Designing a Map Editor Mode that can be shared online with the Clan or Globally. (Inspired by *Fortnite's Creative Mode*)
- Implementing in-game bonuses to vary the game experience. Bonuses that can appear on the map to get higher attack speed, damage, ... etc.
